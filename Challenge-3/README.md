## Challenge 3
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

## Approach

Added javascript which will iterate through the object  value and extract the key and and values

Detail steps of execution mentioned as a commentline 

Other alternatives available

Use of Lodash libraries

It makes JavaScript easier for below functionlities  

    1)Iterating arrays, objects, & strings
    2)Manipulating & testing values
    3)Creating composite functions

Due to time constraints , I am not able to explore much on Lodash libraries, it can make the code much simpler and less lengthy code
